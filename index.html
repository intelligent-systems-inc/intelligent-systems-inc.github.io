            Q. What is <span>backend wiring</span>?
            </h2><h2>
            A. The hooks that contain the API calls to your backend. These hooks are then used by your frontend components. See example.
        </h2>

    <div class="q2" style="padding-top: 30px">
        <h2>
            Q. Oh the fetch calls in frontend? I use AI for that.
        </h2><h2>
            A. Yeah we do too! But have you ever deployed any AI generated code without looking it over first?
            <br><br>
            LLMs are great but donâ€™t work without human supervision. They require specific prompts and extensive guard-rails and continuous testing for reliable, production-ready generations. Read more on our experiments to generate OpenAPI specs from backend.

        <h2>
            Q. Like I said: it is just fetch calls. They are simple enough that I can manage any corrections myself.<span style="font-size: xx-large">ðŸ¤·ðŸ’…</span>
        </h2><h2>
            A. Exactly. You shouldnâ€™t have to.
            <br><br>
            AI-assisted development will scale only if generations have a degree of reliability. Itâ€™s the same as working with a junior engineerâ€”if you had to rewrite their code every time, you wouldnâ€™t call it help. CxAg makes sure the â€˜juniorâ€™ gets it right the first time.

    <div class="q4" style="padding-top: 30px">
        <h2>
            Q. Is this even worth it?
        </h2><h2>
        A. I know we treat documentation lightly. Think about what APIs represent. Knowing how to access an API is the foundation of building anything meaningful. AI is limited in its own way. Think about what documentation is creating meaningful context for AI.
        <br><br>
        If documentation of APIs cannot be solved for, we are far away from a world where software writes itself. Presenting AI with an understanding of any given API is a foundational element.

        A. Glad you asked! :D
